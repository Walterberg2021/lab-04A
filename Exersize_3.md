## Key Definitions

### Academic Integrity
> Within an academic environment, “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: **honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.**”  
> From these values flow principles of behaviour that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action to ensure the credentials granted to students accurately reflect their demonstrated knowledge and abilities.

- **Contract cheating** — When a student submits academic work created by a third party as if it were their own for credit.  
- **Falsification/fabrication** — Misrepresenting another’s work or forging personal documentation (medical, academic, placement, etc.) to gain advantage.
